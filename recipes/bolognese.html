  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 bottle of tomato passata</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1 celery stalk</li>
    <li>1 small carrot</li>
    <li>500g of minced meat (mixed pork and beef is the best in my opinion)</li>
    <li>spices and herbs (basil, oregano)</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Put olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, and 1 pinch salt; cook and stir
      until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir meat into vegetables; cook and stir until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season with
      1 1/2 teaspoons salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Pour tomato mixture into the pan; fill the tomato can with a bit of water, shake it and stir into sauce. Bring
      to a boil.</li>
    <li>After the meat is soft and tender, mix in some fresh herbs, cook it for 2 more minutes and remove from heat.
      Serve hot over pasta. Enjoy!</li>
